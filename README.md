# SAP-NPM-API-collection

Collection of API documentation from currently available npm packages from SAP.

All of this information is available within each package. I am simply putting
everything in one place for ease of reference.

Each packages api's can be found in the apis folder.

These are the currently listed packages from SAP, found with an npm search, with brief descriptions(click README.md, then click 'Raw')

You could also find 3 other packages in the node_modules, downloaded as dependencies, so I've included them.

### install MKDocs and dependencies
```
sudo pip3 install mkdocs
sudo pip3 install mkdocs-material
sudo pip3 install mkdocs-minify-plugin
sudo pip3 install mkdocs-awesome-pages-plugin
```
