## Version 4.7.0 - 2021-12-06

### Added

- `cds add data --for` can be passed a regular expression, allowing more flexible name filters.  For example `--for '^Supplier$'` would only match entity `Supplier`, but not `SupplierAddress`.  Note that as before, `--for Supplier` is interpreted as `--for '^Supplier.*'`, i.e. matches both entities.
- `cds init --add hana` and `cds add hana` now add a `undeploy.json` file containing wildcards. This ensures that SAP HANA artefacts are automatically cleaned-up in case views, unique keys or constraint definitions of associations have been changed in CDS model.

### Fixed

- `cds import` throws warning messages for unsupported data types.
- `cds watch` allows the explicit `--with-mocks` option, although this is anyways included by default

### Fixed

- `cds import` fix for TypeError issue during OData V2 EDMX conversion to CSN.
- `cds import <file_name>` fix now updates the service name in the `package.json` with only the file name. Earlier, the service name sometimes used to be of the form `A.B`, with `A` being file name and `B` being a part of the schema namespace value in the EDMX file

### Changed

- `cds init` uses latest Maven Java archetype version `1.20.3` for creating Java projects.

## Version 4.6.3 - 2021-11-16

### Fixed

- `cds repl` now finds modules like `hdb` that are installed locally in the app folder
- `cds repl` now enables the `await` statement also on Windows
- `cds lint` now limits all file extensions to those allowed by the @sap/eslint-plugin-cds ESLint configuration

## Version 4.6.0 - 2021-11-02
### Added

- `cds compile --to openapi` adds support for OpenAPI 3 to `cds compile`.
- If the server port is in use, `cds watch` offers to restart the server with a new port.
- `cds init` uses latest `Maven Java archetype` version `1.11.0` for creating Java projects.
- `cds init --add pipeline` and `cds add pipeline` will now use the general purpose pipeline of project "Piper".
- `cds login`, `cds extend` and `cds activate` now also support clientid/clientsecret as parameters. This is needed when extending multitenant
applications provided as as reusable services
(see [CP documentation](https://controlcenter.ondemand.com/index.html#/knowledge_center/articles/2316430f7d804820934910db736cefbf)).
- `cds init --add mta` and `cds add mta` now always set the `cloud` Spring profile for Java apps. Before, it was only set if a binding to an SAP HANA service was present.

### Changed

- `cds add cf-manifest` now adds a dependency to the `java_buildpack`.
- `sqlite3` is now an optional dependency to `cds-dk`.  This means that an installation failure of `sqlite3`, e.g. in environments w/o Internet connectivity, no longer leads to an overall installation error.  This behavior suits Java applications, as these usually don't need an SQLite database.  Node.js applications still require a proper installation of `sqlite3` if they use this database.

### Fixed

- `cds add cf-manifest` now only adds db-deployer module if HANA service binding exists.
- `cds init --add hana` now adds `requires.db.kind: "sql"` to cds configuration for Node.js and Java
- `cds watch` no longer fails in SAP Business Application Studio when trying to find `sqlite3`.  `cds deploy --to sqlite` still has that issue, which is to be solved in a future version.
- `cds deploy --to hana` now prefers to use an app-local install of `@sap/cds`, much like other `cds` commands

## Version 3.2.1 - 2020-11-20

### Fixed

- `cds import` no longer creates `.csn` files with invalid `kind:ComplexType` fields

## Version 3.2.0 - 2020-11-03

### Added

- `cds watch` now allows to set the `--in-memory` flag that is passed to `serve`.

### Changed

- `@sap/cds-dk` is again shrinkwrapped, so that builds get reproducible again
- All `cds` commands now prefer a local installation of `@sap/cds`.  This enables applications better control over the version of `@sap/cds`.
- `cds add cf-manifest` generates the service application with the `random-route: true` flag, which avoids route clashes on CF during development.

### Fixed

- `cds run` finds its `express` module again in the case where no `express` is installed in the application.
- `cds env` now also displays properties that have a value `false` or `''`.
- Leading flags in `cds` CLI work again, like `cds --to sql my.cds`
- `cds compile --to` w/o an argument now fails with a better message

### Removed

### Fixed
- `cds deploy --to sqlite` now writes `requires.db.model` in `package.json` such that `cds.connect.to.('db')` works w/o further `model` options.
- `cds deploy --to sqlite` with `@sap/cds` 4.2 no longer crashes due to a wrong import

## Version 3.1.0 - 2020-09-30

### Added
- `cds compile` now supports option `flavor` with values: `files` | `sources` | `parsed` | `xtended` | `inferred`.
  + `cds compile --files` maps to `--flavor files`.
  + `cds compile --sources` maps to `--flavor sources`.
  + `cds compile --parse` maps to `--flavor parsed`.
  + `cds compile` maps to `--flavor inferred`.
- `cds add cf-manifest` creates manifest.yml and services-manifest.yml allowing for Cloud Foundry native deployment.
- `cds init` now supports type `nodejs` to create a Node.js based project. This is the default and can be omitted.
- `cds watch`: enter `debug` or `debug-brk` to restart process in debug mode.  Other commands are `ps` and `rs`.

### Changed
- `@sap/cds-dk` is no longer shrinkwrapped, so that new versions from underlying `@sap` packages (like `@sap/cds`) are available w/o a new cds-dk version
- `cds init` uses latest `Maven Java archetype` version `1.9.0` for creating Java projects.

### Fixed
- `cds watch` now passes all environment variables to the spawned sub processes, enabling for example, `cds watch --production`

## Version 2.0.8 - 2020-08-07

### Changed
- `cds init` uses latest `Maven Java archetype` version `1.8.1` for creating Java projects.

### Fixed

- Fixed `cds add mta` for java projects. The Spring Cloud Profile is set by default for Java apps in order to enable the SAP HANA service binding, otherwise the sqlite db would still be used at runtime.
  The environment variable JBP_CONFIG_RESOURCE_CONFIGURATION required by the classic Java runtime has been removed.

## Version 2.0.7 - 2020-08-04

### Added
- `cds init` supports adding `samples` via `--add samples`. See `cds help init` for more details.
- **Most CLI commands have moved to `@sap/cds-dk`** from `@sap/cds`.  Make sure to install the latest version with `npm i -g @sap/cds-dk`.
- `cds` commands now log a hint to update to the latest `@sap/cds` if this one is still of version 3.
- New command `cds login` added to simplify usage of `cds extend` and `cds activate` by providing them with automatic authentication and saving project settings.
  Refreshes expired authentication tokens automatically. Optionally uses CF command-line client to determine login URLs and subdomains.
  Saves authentication data in plain-text file or desktop keyring on Linux, macOS or Windows.
  The latter requires an optional Node.js module `keytar` to be installed.
- New command `cds logout` removes authentication data and optionally project settings.

### Changed
- `@sap/cdk` no longer warns about `@sap/cds` being globally installed next to it.  This was a temporary hint for the transition period to `@sap/cds-dk`.
- `cds init` generates dependency to `@sap/cds` version `4` for Nodejs projects.
- Use square brackets to pass array values for options to `cds init --java:mvn`.
- `cds init --add pipeline` and `cds add pipeline` now create file `config.yml` in `.pipeline` folder.
- Improved `launch.json` file which is created during `cds init`.
- `cds add mta` now creates a mta.yaml file that sets the production flag for cds build and npm install.
  This ensures that the HANA artefacts are created if `"kind": "sql"` or some `production` profile has been configured in package.json or .cdsrc.json.
  Requires `@sap/cds` version >=4.x.
- `cds init` uses latest `Maven Java archetype` version `1.7.0` for creating Java projects.
- `cds init` no longer adds `package-lock.json` to `.gitignore` file when creating a new project.
- `cds init --add hana` and `cds add hana` now use `Maven Java archetype` to create HANA related pom.xml entries.
- Consistent default naming scheme for applications and services deployed to CF across the following `cds` commands `build`, `deploy`, `init` and `add`. For an application named `myapp` the SAP HANA deployer app name is `myapp-db-deployer`, the SAP HANA DB service name is `myapp-db`.

### Fixed

- Fixed `cds import` to support imports from symlinked sources
- Fixing bug in `cds init` and `cds add` when using multiple features separated by comma.
- Fixing missing log output bug in `cds init` and `cds add` when using feature `samples`.
